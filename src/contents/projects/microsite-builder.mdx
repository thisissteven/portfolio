## Short Description (Microsite Builder) ✏️

Have you ever seen similar sites looking like the picture above? Microsite builders like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/)
and [S.id](https://home.s.id/) allows you to build one just like that. This project is exactly that kind of site, where
you can customize your own single page site with links directing to your other socials. Check it out
[here](https://stevenn.tech/microsite/new) (try signing in first before creating your microsite).

## Short Description (URL Shortener) ✏️

Do you have a hard time remembering long URLs? Try it out [here](https://stevenn.tech/shorten) and you can easily get
the shortened version of any URL in one click. The slug of the shortened URL is also free for you to choose, which is
not usually the case with free URL shortener services.

## Project Goals 🎯

This is my first fullstack project, and I wanted to make an app that can handle CRUD operations. After my first
encounter with the link shortener S.id, I wanted to make my own too. At the end, this site enable users to create, read,
update, and delete shortened URLs.

## Features 🔧

- Build your own microsite
- Unlimited URLs to shorten
- Manage shortened URLs in your profile settings
- Delete unused shortened URLs

## Technologies Used 💻

This site is built using Nextjs, Chakra UI, Strapi, Firebase, and deployed [here](https://stevenn.tech/) using Vercel.
