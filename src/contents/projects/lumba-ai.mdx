## Short Description ✏️

This project is a typing speed test based on Monkeytype, where you can either play alone or with friends (yes, the site
allows you to chat with the public, create rooms, and play together in real time).

## Project Goals 🎯

I wanted to learn how to use socket.io, and I chose to clone monkeytype because they did not have a multiplayer feature.

## Features 🔧

- Upload & Clean Dataset
- Train models
-

## Technologies Used 💻

The site is built using Nextjs, Tailwind, SWR, and Chart.js
