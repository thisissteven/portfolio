## Short Description ✏️

This site is the first iteration of my personal portfolio and blog, where I post the things I learned in my journey.
Some of the posts you see are written by other developers whom I learned a lot from.

## Project Goals 🎯

After learning about web development for a year or two, I wanted to have my own portfolio site. Sometimes I forgot about
syntax and I usually search it up on the web. Instead of doing that, I thought why not make my own blogs or snippets
page, where I can keep other dev's post in one place. Hopefully, with this site being updated constantly in the future,
I can help other devs too, and also write my own blog 😎

## Technologies Used 💻

This site is built using Nextjs, Tailwind, MDX, and deployed on Vercel.
