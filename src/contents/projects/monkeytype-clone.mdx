## Short Description ✏️

This project is a typing speed test based on Monkeytype, where you can either play alone or with friends (yes, the site
allows you to chat with the public, create rooms, and play together in real time).

## Project Goals 🎯

I wanted to learn how to use socket.io, and I chose to clone monkeytype because they did not have a multiplayer feature
(actually I found out that they do, after finishing my project 🤦‍♂️).

## Features 🔧

- Command Palette (switch between themes, modes, font family, etc.)
- Top 100 Leaderboard (daily and all time)
- Multiplayer Gameplay
- Public and Room Chat
- Mobile responsive

## Technologies Used 💻

The site is built using Nextjs, Tailwind, Socket.io, Strapi, and deployed [here](https://mtype.vercel.app) using Vercel.
